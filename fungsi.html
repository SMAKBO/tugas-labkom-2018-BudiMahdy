<body><center><h1>Uses</h1></center><p>It is particularly important as a solvent in the production of cellulose plastics such as <font color="red">cellulose acetate.</font></p><br>
  <ul>
  	<li>Fuel</li><br><p>Diethyl ether has a high <font color="red">cetane number</font> of 85-96 and is used as a <font color="red">starting fluid</font>, in combination with petroleum distillates for gasoline and Diesel engines because of its <font color="red">high volatility and low flash point</font>. Ether starting fluid is sold and used in countries with cold climates, as it can help with cold starting an engine at sub-zero temperatures. For the same reason it is also used as a component of the fuel mixture for <font color="red">carbureted compression ignition model engines</font>. In this way diethyl ether is very similar to one of its precursors, <font color="red">ethanol</font>.</p>
  	<li>Laboratory uses</li><br><p>Diethyl ether is a common laboratory <font color="red">aprotic solvent</font>. It has <font color="red">limited solubility in water</font> (6.05 g/100 ml at 25 °C) and dissolves 1.5 g/100 g (1.0 g/100 ml) water at 25 °C. This, coupled with its high volatility, makes it ideal for use as the non-polar solvent <font color="red">in liquid-liquid extraction</font>. When used with an aqueous solution, the diethyl ether layer is on top as it has a lower density than the water. It is also a common solvent for the <font color="red">Grignard reaction</font> in addition to other reactions involving organometallic reagents. Due to its application in the manufacturing of illicit substances, it is listed in the Table II precursor under the <font color="red">United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances</font> as well as substances such as acetone, toluene and sulfuric acid.</p>
  	<li>Anesthetic use</li><br><p>participated in a public demonstration of ether anesthesia on October 16, 1846 at the Ether Dome in Boston, Massachusetts. However, Crawford Williamson Long, M.D., is now known to have demonstrated its use privately as a general anesthetic in surgery to officials in Georgia, as early as March 30, 1842, and Long publicly demonstrated ether's use as a surgical anesthetic on six occasions before the Boston demonstration.[13][14][15] British doctors were aware of the anesthetic properties of ether as early as 1840 where it was widely prescribed in conjunction with opium.[16] Diethyl ether largely supplanted the use of chloroform as a general anesthetic due to ether's more favorable therapeutic index, that is, a greater difference between an effective dose and a potentially toxic dose.[17] Because of its associations with Boston, the use of ether became known as the "Yankee Dodge."

	Diethyl ether depresses the myocardium and increases tracheobronchial secretions.[18] Diethyl ether could also be mixed with other anesthetic agents such as chloroform to make C.E. mixture, or chloroform and alcohol to make A.C.E. mixture. In the 2000s, ether is rarely used. The use of flammable ether was displaced by nonflammable fluorinated hydrocarbon anesthetics. Halothane was the first such anesthetic developed and other currently used inhaled anesthetics, such as isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane, are halogenated ethers.[19] Diethyl ether was found to have undesirable side effects, such as post-anesthetic nausea and vomiting. Modern anesthetic agents reduce these side 	effects.[13]

	Prior to 2005 it was on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines for use as an anesthetic.</p>
