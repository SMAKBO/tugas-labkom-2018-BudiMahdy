     It is commonly used as solven in laboratories and as a starting fluid for some engines.
     It was formerly used as a general anestheic, until non-flammable drugs were developed, such as halothane.
     It has been used as a recreational drug to cause intoxication.

The amount of ether required depends on the body weight and condition of the patient, the need for anesthesia and the techniques used. Induction dose 10-20% by volume of vapor ether in oxygen or oxygen mixture and N2O. Dose of maintenance of stage III 5-15% vapor ether volume.
